# ðŸ›£ Traffic Accidents Analysis Project



# ðŸ“˜ About the Project

This project analyzes traffic accidents data to identify patterns, causes, and potential solutions for reducing accident rates.

The analysis covers multiple dimensions such as weather, time, driver condition, and road type.



# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw accident data using Python.

Explore key questions using SQL (theoretical queries).

Build two dashboards:

One in Excel (interactive visualization using charts & pivot tables).

One in Power BI (for deeper insights and KPIs).

Present the main findings and recommendations in a PowerPoint report.

# ðŸ“Š Main Insights (Example)

Most accidents occur in urban areas during daytime.

Weather and visibility significantly affect accident severity.

Young drivers (18â€“25) and fatigue/alcohol are common risk factors.
